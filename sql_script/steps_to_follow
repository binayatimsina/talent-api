mysql -u dbuser -p
    password --> passpass

[Considering you already have your table schema on your system]
pwd --> .....sql_script

delete from user; [Considering you already ran talent_user.sql. Here we're trying to insert more data]

source ./talent_user.sql;
select * from user;
source ./talent_candidate.sql;
select * from candidate;
source ./talent_job.sql;
select * from job;
source ./talent_manager.sql;
select * from manager;
